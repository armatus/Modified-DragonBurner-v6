This is a slight remix of Chirpy's DragonBurner toolhead, mostly just making some extra room for wires.  My version is hardware specific, this design only works with Dragon hotends and LGX extruders.  I have included two versions of the hotend mounting plate and extruder mounting plate, one set is flat for regular mounts, the other is slightly angled to fight the nozzle droop of Boop.  The wiring shroud for the LGX does not use a breakout board, but does have ample space to use quick disconnects for each component.  If you print 20mm standoffs instead of buying brass standoffs for the wiring shroud, the heat of the motor + enclosure will melt them.
